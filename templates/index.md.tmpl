# PingFederate Provider

The PingFederate provider is used to interact with the many resources supported by the PingFederate admin API. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.


## Example Usage
Terraform 0.13 and later:
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pingfederate = {
      source  = "iwarapter/pingfederate"
      version = "~> 0.0.7"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingfederate" {
  username = "Administrator"
  password = "2Access"
  base_url = "https://localhost:9999"
  context  = "/pf-admin-api/v1"
}

# Create a authentication policy contract
resource "pingfederate_authentication_policy_contract" "demo" {
  # ...
}
```
Terraform 0.12 and earlier:

```hcl
# Configure the PingFederate Provider
provider "pingfederate" {
  username = "Administrator"
  password = "2Access"
  base_url = "https://localhost:9999"
  context  = "/pf-admin-api/v1"
}

# Create a authentication policy contract
resource "pingfederate_authentication_policy_contract" "demo" {
  # ...
}
```

## Authentication

The PingFederate provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication. The following methods are supported, in this order, and explained below:

- Static credentials

- Environment variables

### Static credentials
Static credentials can be provided by adding an `username` and `password` in-line in the PingFederate provider block:

Usage:
```hcl
provider "pingfederate" {
  username = "Administrator"
  password = "2Access"
  base_url = "https://localhost:9999"
  context  = "/pf-admin-api/v1"
}
```

### Environment variables
You can provide your credentials via the `PINGFEDERATE_USERNAME`, `PINGFEDERATE_PASSWORD`, `PINGFEDERATE_CONTEXT` and `PINGFEDERATE_BASEURL` environment variables.

```hcl
provider "pingfederate" {}
```

Usage:
```bash
$ export PINGFEDERATE_USERNAME="Administrator"
$ export PINGFEDERATE_PASSWORD="top_secret"
$ export PINGFEDERATE_CONTEXT="/pf-admin-api/v1"
$ export PINGFEDERATE_BASEURL="https://myadmin.server:9999"
$ terraform plan
```

## Argument Reference

In addition to [generic `provider` arguments](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html)
(e.g. `alias` and `version`), the following arguments are supported in the PingFederate
 `provider` block:

* `username` - (Required) This is the PingFederate administrative username. It must be provided, but
  it can also be sourced from the `PINGFEDERATE_USERNAME` environment variable.

* `password` - (Required) This is the PingFederate administrative password. It must be provided, but
  it can also be sourced from the `PINGFEDERATE_PASSWORD` environment variable.

* `base_url` - (Required) This is the PingFederate base url (protocol:server:port). It must be provided, but
  it can also be sourced from the `PINGFEDERATE_BASEURL` environment variable.

* `context` - (Optional) This is the PingFederate context path for the admin API, defaults to `/pf-admin-api/v1`
and can be sourced from the `PINGFEDERATE_CONTEXT` environment variable.

* `bypass_external_validation` - (Optional) Whether to ignore external validation of resources within PingFederate defaults to `false`.
