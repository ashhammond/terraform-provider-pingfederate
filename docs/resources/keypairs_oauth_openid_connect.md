# pingfederate_keypairs_oauth_openid_connect (Resource)

Manages the PingFederate instance OAuth/OpenID singing and decryption key settings.

-> This resource manages a singleton within PingFederate and as such you should ONLY ever declare one of this resource type. Deleting this resource simply stops tracking changes.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingfederate_keypairs_oauth_openid_connect" "example" {
  static_jwks_enabled = true
  rsa_active_cert_ref {
    id = pingfederate_keypair_signing.new.id
  }
  rsa_previous_cert_ref {
    id = pingfederate_keypair_signing.old.id
  }
  rsa_publish_x5c_parameter = true
}
```
